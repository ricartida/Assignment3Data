        Unlicensed taxi hustlers in New York City can prey on tourists at airports, charging hundreds of dollars for rides that should cost around $75. These drivers evade safety checks and licensing requirements mandated for TLC drivers, siphoning business from legitimate operators. Despite the crackdowns, the problem persists, exacerbated by the rise of rideshare apps that make it harder to distinguish between licensed drivers and unregulated hustlers.
      </p>
      <p>
        New York’s airports—JFK, LaGuardia, and Newark—serve as fertile ground for unlicensed drivers. They target disoriented travelers unfamiliar with city transportation rules, offering “deals” that often result in hefty fares. These rides avoid TLC regulations, posing safety risks and undermining the city’s fleet of licensed drivers already struggling to compete with rideshare giants.

        <h2>Unlicensed Summons and Overcharging Summons</h2>
        <p>
          Port Authority and TLC officers are authorized to issue summonses at the airports for violations of TLC regulations. When a driver gets caught, they are issued an initial summons as a TLC violation, processed and adjudicated through New York City’s Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings (OATH), with a penalty of $1,500 and even the impoundment of their vehicle. (Criminal violations under New York laws are heard in Queens state courts.)
        </p>
        <p>
          According to Port Authority data, the number of summonses across LGA and JFK increased 71% from 2022 to 2023. Port Authority attributed to uptick to increased policing to target hustling. 2024 is currently on track to surpass last year. JFK has a particularly high rate of incidents.

        <h2>Persistent Issues and Observations</h2>
        <p>
          Despite these figures, the actual scale of illegal activity likely far exceeds enforcement levels. In 2016, in recognition of a growing problem, Uber conducted an independent, 15-day study of pick-ups at LaGuardia and JFK. And it measured 2,300 illegal trips per week from JFK and LaGuardia combined.
        </p>
        <p>
          The issue isn’t new. In 2018, a pursuit of an unlicensed driver at LaGuardia led to a crash, prompting renewed Port Authority promises to address the problem. Yet, the persistence of violations suggests deeper systemic issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eric Goldwyn of NYU highlights that rideshare apps like Uber and Lyft have blurred distinctions between “hail” and “pre-arrange” rides, creating regulatory gaps. These ambiguities make it harder to enforce TLC rules consistently, especially as rideshare platforms redefine the industry.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hustlers typically approach passengers curbside at arrivals, offering rides under the guise of being Uber or Lyft drivers. They assure customers of fixed rates but often charge inflated fares, sometimes through personal card readers. This behavior is not only deceptive but also unregulated, leaving passengers with no recourse.

        <h2>Airport Observations</h2>
        <p>
          Over the course of this investigation, all three major airports were visited to observe unlicensed taxi activity:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>LaGuardia:</strong> Limited unlicensed activity was observed due to strong Port Authority presence. Announcements and signage were minimal and not in multiple languages, reducing their effectiveness in warning tourists.</li>
          <li><strong>JFK:</strong> Despite its reputation as a hotspot for hustlers, JFK showed varying levels of enforcement. Terminal 5 appeared controlled, with rideshare operations centralized at Terminal 7. However, unlicensed drivers were still spotted soliciting travelers.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="chartWrapper">
          <iframe title="Unlicensed Taxi Activity at NYC Airports" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-Dr7ty" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Dr7ty/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 100%; height: 500px; border: none;"></iframe>
          <script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();</script>

        Unlicensed taxi hustlers remain a persistent issue at New York City’s airports, exploiting tourists and undermining legitimate drivers. Despite increased enforcement, regulatory gaps and chaotic airport environments allow these activities to thrive. Addressing the problem requires clearer traveler warnings, stronger coordination with rideshare platforms, and sustained efforts to close enforcement loopholes. Without action, both passengers and the city’s licensed drivers will continue to face the consequences.
